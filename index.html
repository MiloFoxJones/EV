<p class="ex1">
    <pre>
        Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are being forced into the car market, to replace ICEs, to reduce 
        carbon emissions and combat global warming, with major government investments supporting their development as a 
        sustainable transportation solution. The UK government has introduced policies, including a ban on new petrol and 
        diesel vehicles by 2035 and incentives for BEV adoption. This atrticle will evaluate BEVs alongside other alternatives, 
        such as hydrogen and synthetic fuels, considering each option's potential to address environmental challenges and create 
        sustainable transportation for the future.

<h4 id="What are the key drawbacks of petrol, diesel and the internal combustion engine?" style="font-size: 22px; font-family: Calibri;">What are the key drawbacks of petrol, diesel, and the internal combustion engine?</h4>
<p class="ex1">
    <pre>
        Transportation, including personal travel, goods transport, and vehicle use in agriculture and industry, is
        one of the largest contributors to global warming. In 2022, the UK’s transport sector accounted for 34% of
        domestic carbon dioxide emissions, with the majority from road transport emissions(2). However, emissions aren’t the only
        issue with internal combustion engines. Current ICE infrastructure is highly inefficient, as only 
        16–20% (3) of fuel in petrol engines is converted to movement, with the rest wasted as heat. Diesel engines are
        somewhat more efficient, converting around 24–28% (3) of fuel into motion, but have higher carbon footprints and
        release harmful particulate pollution, increasing cancer risks for those exposed.(4) So clearly there is a need
        for change, but what are the options?

<h4 id="The benefits of battery-powered electric vehicles" style="font-size: 22px; font-family: Calibri;">The benefits of battery-powered electric vehicles</h4>
<p class="ex1">
    <pre>
        Battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs) have resurged as viable options for sustainable transport, largely due
        to advancements in lithium-ion technology, which is far more efficient than older lead-acid batteries.
        Today, BEVs are used for their zero tailpipe emissions, contributing to cleaner urban air and lessening the
        impact of transport on climate change. Unlike internal combustion engines (ICEs), BEVs are powered by electricity,
        which can increasingly be sourced from renewable energy, reducing emissions further (1).

<h4 id="The problems with battery-powered electric vehicles" style="font-size: 22px; font-family: Calibri;">The problems with battery-powered electric vehicles</h4>
<p class="ex1">
    <pre>
        Battery Efficiency:
        Electric motors are efficient, but their batteries lag behind. Tesla's top battery in 2023 had an energy density 
        of  272-296 Wh/kg (8), far less than petrol’s 13,100 Wh/kg (9), which is about 44 times higher! Since petrol is 
        far lighter and can be carried in smaller spaces, this makes petrol more suitable for applications like aviation 
        and shipping.

<h4 id="Zero-Carbon Alternatives to Electric Vehicles" style="font-size: 22px; font-family: Calibri;">Zero-Carbon Alternatives to Electric Vehicles</h4>
<p class="ex1">
    <pre>
        With 1.45 billion internal combustion engine vehicles in use globally in 2022 (15), alternatives to fossil 
        fuels are urgently needed.
